# Machine-Learning
This project is focusing on the practical implementation of classification models in supervised learning. It showcases the development and evaluation of four distinct classification models, including a detailed exploration of a kernel SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier utilizing grid search and cross-validation techniques.
